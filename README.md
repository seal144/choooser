## Description

This project is called CHOOSER, a web application designed to streamline group decision-making processes. CHOOSER aims to provide a system for selecting the best choice from multiple options in a group setting. The app is still in development phase, but some of the key features are already introduced:

- Authentication with three methods: email + password, Google, and anonymous sign-up.
- App settings allowing users to change the color theme, display name, or delete their account.
- Creating and joining groups (rooms) for collaboration with other users.
- Room view with integrated chat functionality for real-time communication among group members.

The current development phase is published as the "[Communicator](https://choooser.vercel.app/)" web app, a fully functional application for group chatting.
